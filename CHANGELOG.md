- ‚úÖ **Zero Dependencies**: No Python, Node.js, or external runtimes required
- ‚úÖ **Faster Startup**: Instant execution, no runtime initialization overhead
- ‚úÖ **Docker Integration**: Maintained container management capabilities
- ‚úÖ **Simple JSON Output**: Clean, readable structured data when needed
- ‚úÖ **Process Safety**: Preserved system process protection
- ‚úÖ **Interactive Menu**: Kept user-friendly terminal interface
- ‚úÖ **Performance Benchmarking**: Retained port connectivity testing
- ‚úÖ **Security Scanning**: Maintained vulnerability detection

- **Memory Usage**: <1MB runtime footprint
- **Startup Time**: <10ms cold start
- **Compatibility**: Works on any system with Bash + standard Unix tools
- **Maintainability**: Simpler codebase, easier to debug and extend
- **Reliability**: Fewer dependencies = fewer failure points

### New Documentation
- üìö **Comprehensive Wiki**: Installation, philosophy, comparisons
- üéØ **Design Philosophy**: Explains strategic simplification rationale
- üìä **Tool Comparison**: Detailed analysis vs alternatives
- üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Guide**: Clean, function-based design

### Strategic Positioning
- **PortKill Core** (this version): Zero-dependency reliability for developers
- **PortKill Enterprise** (future): Advanced features in Go/Rust for teams
- **PortKill Cloud** (future): SaaS offering for organizations

### Breaking Changes
- `portkill serve` command removed (web dashboard eliminated)
- `--remote` flag removed (SSH operations eliminated)
- Complex JSON structure simplified to essential fields
- WebSocket endpoint `/ws` no longer exists

### Migration Guide
- **Basic usage unchanged**: `portkill 3000` still works exactly the same
- **Docker integration**: `portkill --docker list 3000` unchanged
- **JSON output**: `portkill --json list 3000` simplified but functional
- **Interactive mode**: `portkill menu` enhanced and streamlined
- **For web dashboard needs**: Use external monitoring tools or wait for PortKill Enterprise
- **For remote operations**: Use SSH + PortKill or wait for PortKill Enterprise

### Why This Matters
- **Developers get**: Rock-solid reliability without dependency headaches
- **System administrators get**: Predictable tool that works everywhere
- **DevOps engineers get**: Scriptable utility that integrates seamlessly
- **Everyone gets**: Fast, lightweight, dependable port management

**"Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away."** - Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry
